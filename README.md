###A bit about my way throught this course:

I started by watching the initial [2008 youtube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL02662D79DFBFE720) by Professor Julie Zelenski and doing the first assignemnts. As I progressed I started reading the [CS106BX course reader](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs106b/materials/CS106BX-Reader.pdf) more and more. Eventually I switched from the youtube lectures to only reading the book as it was deeper/broader and better strucutered in my opinion. I did do a few of the exercises from book, and the solutions for those are also here.

I did not do Assignemnt 3 as I did many similar exercises in the book. 
As for Assignemnt 4, I instead I made a simple mobile game in Unty [Numboggle](https://github.com/diogoamvasconcelos/numboogle-code-samples).

I strongly recommend this course and the [CS106BX course reader](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs106b/materials/CS106BX-Reader.pdf).
